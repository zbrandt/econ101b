\begin{homeworkProblem}[1]
    In this question, we explore whether government budget deficits are 
    inflationary. In the medieval economy, we assumed that prices adjusted
    to a change in the money supply with a delay. To simplify things in this
    question, we will instead assume that prices are ``perfectly flexible'' ---
    i.e., respond immediately one-for-one to any change in the money supply.
    In other words, we assume that $M_t = P_t$, where $M_t$ is the nominal 
    value of money in the economy in year $t$ --- i.e., the quantity of dollar
    bills outstanding --- and $P_t$ is the price level in year $t$. Notice that
    this is a simplifed version of $M_t \overline{V} = P_t Y_t$, where $\overline{V}
    = 1$, and $Y_t = 1$. 
    \\ \\
    Let's denote the \underline{real value} of government spending on goods and 
    services in year $t$ by $G_t$ and the real value tax revenue in year $t$ by
    $T_t$. Suppose the government can issue one-year debt. Let's denote by $B_t$
    the real value of such debt issued by the government in year $t$ to be paid 
    off with interest in year $t+1$. Finally, let's denote the net real interest
    rate that the government has ot pay on its debt between year $t-1$ and year $t$
    by $R_{t-1}$.
    \\ \\
    The consolidated government budget constraint is then given by
    \[
        \begin{split}
            G_t + (1 + R_{t-1}) B_t &= T_t + B_t + \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}
        \end{split}
    \]
    The way to interpret this equation is that the terms on the left hand side are
    all the things the government spends money on in year $t$: It purchases goods
    and services, and it pays off the debt it issued in year $t-1$; The terms on the
    right hand side are all the sources of inflow of money into the government 
    coffers in year $t$: tax revenue, income from the sale of new debt, and new money
    issued by the central bank. The equation is written in real terms, which is why
    the change in the quantity of money must be divided by the price level to get how
    much ``stuff'' the new money can buy in year $t$.
    \\ \\
    Suppose that in year $t=0$ the government starts off with no debt to pay off ---
    i.e., $B_{-1} = 0$. Suppose also that the real interest rate that the government
    must pay on its debt is constant at 5\%, i.e., $R_t=0.05$ for all $t$. Furthermore,
    suppose the amount of money in the economy in year $t=-1$ is $M_{-1}$. 
    \\ \\
    Suppose that the institutional setup in this economy is that there is an 
    ``independent'' central bank that chooses $M_t$ in each year and Congress 
    chooses $G_t$ and $T_t$. Jointly, these choices will then determine how much 
    debt will need to be issued by the government in year $t$. 
    \\ \\
    A) Suppose the central bank is determined not to allow any inflation. How 
    should it set the money supply to achieve this?
    \\ \\
    B) Suppose that dysfunctional politics in this country implies that Congress 
    refuses to collect enough taxes to pay for the amount of spending it decides to 
    do. (Alternatively, one could say that it decides to spend more than the amount 
    of taxes it decides to collect. Specifically, suppose $G_t = 0.25$, while $T_t
    = 0.15$. Given the monetary policy from part A), use the government budget constraint
    to calculate how government debt evolves over the next 30 years. It is convenient
    to do this in Excel. 
    \\ \\
    C) Now suppose that the bond market in this country puts an upper limit on the amount
    that it is willing to lend to the government. Suppose this upper limit is equal to
    1 --- i.e., 100\% of GDP. This means that government debt is constrained to be less
    than or equal to 1, i.e., $B_t \leq 1$. In which year will this constraint bind?
    \\ \\
    Imagine that we reach the year in which the constraint in part C) starts binding. 
    Some adjustment is needed to balance the government's budget. But what type of 
    adjustment? We will now see that it depends on which institution is stronger, the
    central bank or Congress. Let's consider each case in turn. 
    \\
    D) Suppose the central bank is compeletely independent and that its commitment to no
    inflation is sufficiently strong that Congress cannot force the central bank to abandon
    its policy. Describe the adjustment Congress is forced to make in this case once the
    constraint binds. In particular, calculate the primary suprlus, $T_t - G_t$, that 
    Congress will need to set in the period that the constraint binds and in subsequent
    periods (up to period 30). 
    \\ \\
    E) Suppose instead the Congress can push the central bank around and get it to change 
    its monetary policy once the constraint binds. What will inflation be after the government's
    budget hits the constraint under the assumption that Congress doesn't change the primary
    surplus but rather forces the central bank to ``monetize'' its deficit spending after that 
    point? More specifically, calculate the inflation rate in the year the constraint binds and
    in subsequent years up to year 30.
