\begin{homeworkProblem}[2]
    Indicate whether you think the following statements are true, false or 
    uncertain. Support your answer by giving all necessary reasoning and 
    calculations:
    \\ \\
    A) The discovery of large gold and silver mines in the Americas in the
    16\textsuperscript{th} century greatly increased the purchasing power
    of people in Europe.
    \\ \\
    \textbf{False}. The influx of gold and silver into a Europe where these 
    metals served as money did not broadly increase the purchasing power of 
    people. Purchasing power is the amount of goods and services one can buy
    with money. If only the money supply increases, all other things being 
    equal, this will simply cause an increase in prices, as producers adjust 
    prices to excess demand stimulated by an increase in the money supply.
    \\ \\
    
    B) According to the quantity theory of money, ``inflation is always
    and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.''
    \\ \\
    \textbf{True}. According to the quantity theory of money, the price
    level is directly proportional to the money supply, and that there is a 
    causality between changes in the money supply and changes in the price 
    level. The above statement corresponds with this idea, since inflation 
    (rising of prices), results in an increase in the money supply.
